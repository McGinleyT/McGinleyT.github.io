            <p>
                Cyclone is a 15-pound battlebot designed, built, tested, and battled by a team of four I was a part of
                for the Centerville High School engineering class. The whole project took about 11 months and $976 to
                complete. It uses a lawnmower blade as its weapon, providing it high durability and high flexibility
                and letting it manage hits very well. Cyclone was a test of our machining capabilities requiring use of
                mills, lathes, routers, wire EDMs,
                some manual and some CNC. The design process challenged our knowlegdge of CAD software and the
                engineering design process.
            </p>
            <p>
                My contributions to the team began with my background in technical drawings. Once our parts began their
                design stages, I was able to make some of the drawings of the parts from the 3D model. The team decided
                to give me some of the more complicated drawings, while the more basic drawings were given to be done by
                the people who had less experience with making drawings. Over time, some prints needed to be changed and
                I would often check the drawings to make sure all necessary dimensions were measured to the proper
                accuracy and tolerance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soldering was another area I had some experience in while going into this project. I had, in the past,
                soldered small through-hole projects on my own. The soldering we had to do for our robot was a little
                different from the smaller circuits I worked on in the past. We needed to solder 14 AWG and 12 AWG wires
                together, attached to bullet connectors, and battery connectors. Soldering clean joints and keeping all
                connectors insulated with heat shrink is necessary to ensure the batteries, motors, ESCs and radio
                receiver didn't short out. I made it a priority to keep all exposed wires cleanly connected and wrapped.
            </p>

            <p>
                The project resulted in our bot placing first place for high school teams and second place overall at
                the fall 2019 Xtreme BOTS tournament. I recently returned to the event to help the current Centerville
                High School teams with necessary repairs between fights.

            <blockquote>
                "One of the most difficult issues to overcome during the Cyclone design process was the design of the
                weapon's bearing housing. A design with a stationary weapon shaft along with a roller-bearing housing
                had never been done in the 15 pound division, so it was definitely a challenge designing something from
                scratch that was unproven."

                This website was done as a project for my HTML and CSS class at Sinclair Community College. It is meant
                to be a show of my abilities with HTML and CSS that I learned during the semester. Every line of code
                was typed from scratch! My prior programming experience was with structured or object-oriented and
                working with a markup language took a little getting used to. After getting familiar with it, I find
                myself going into other website's source files and seeing what bits I can parse though most of them use
                more elaborate frontend frameworks.

                This was second drone I custom built, and the one still operational today. I wanted to make a UAV that
                was more stable in flight and a bit more compact. Its frame is a 250mm 115g carbon fiber, with a unique
                mounting orientation. For my electronics stack I used a Rush Tank VTX, DALRC F405 AIO flight controller,
                and a dual-antenna Spektrum RX. My ESCs needed to be mounted on the frame arms (which were very thin),
                so I used four Flycolor 36A X Cross Slims and connected them to EMAX RS2205 2300KV motors which provided
                good torque and a design that actively cooled the motor coils. I've gone through several sets of
                propellers, but consistently have success with Ethix S5 tri-blades. My camera is currently a Foxeer Mini
                Predator, but may be replaced in the near future. Oxygen is built for 4s batteries, so it's not the
                fastest drone I've made but it's light and agile and very consistent.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to go for a very unique designed frame that
                would maximize my stability by putting the center of mass both very close to the flight controller and
                close to the plane of the propellers. In order to meet these conditions, I picked a frame that mounted
                the battery at the level of the motors and would have my stack hang below that level. Normally the other
                way around, with the electronics stack inline with the motors and battery hanging below, this
                orientation required me to mount my stack upside-down relative to the motors. It took some playing
                around with Betaflight to make my flight controller believe it was right side up before it was working
                properly.

            <p>
                This was my first foray into building freestyle and racing drones. Wendigo was very much a testbed to
                see what worked and what would result in catastrophe when changing PID settings, batteries, and
                propellers.
                The parts that stayed consistent were the DALRC F405 flight controller, DALRC Engine Pro 4-in-1 ESC, and
                Emax ECO2306 2400kv motors. The VTX, RX, and camera were largely the same as Oxygen.
            </p>
            <p>
                This drone experienced several communications issues causing spinouts and video losses. The frame took
                heavy damage from a number of crashes and Wendigo was disassembled, its electronics de-soldered,
                disconnected and cleaned, and the UAV as we know it was retired in early 2021.

                J&ouml;tunn Comparer is an open-source project started by <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-downs-1401a3186" id="jcLink">Connor Downs</a> and myself. The
                project was incentive for us to learn the Python programming language and how to access APIs. We used
                the code we developed to access player data from the game Destiny 2 using the Bungie API. The website is
                hosted on github which does not allow Python scripts to run like JavaScript, forcing us to make a workaround.
                The method I came up with was using a Raspberry Pi as a "server" that would run the Python scripts to
                update the player data and push the data to the github repository. The update process was automated using 
                crontab. This project gave me opportunity to learn Python, API requests, and Debian Linux. The current version
                of the website can be found by clicking the title of this section.

            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I am a student at Sinclair Community College studying computer science. Prior to my education at
                Sinclair, I attended Centerville High School
                where I studied engineering and earned a diploma with honors. I have always been a geek
                at heart. Since I was young, I have loved playing with computers, electronics, and machines - trying to
                learn how they tick. I am also a huge space nerd, frequently watching livestreams of rocket launches and
                tests. I find myself fascinated by the cutting edge of engineering pushing humanity to the stars.
                 I love programming and like to script my own video games and I am always eager to learn new techniques and engines to do so.

            <h2>What are my skills?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The majority of my programming study has been focused on C++ both procedural and object-oriented. I also
                have acquired familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other proprietary languages for applications
                and devices. I have lots of experience with the engineering design process and find myself using it in
                my computer science classes quite a bit to solve programming problems. I build custom drones in my free
                time which has given me a lot of practice with electronics and soldering. In my high school engineering
                class, I spent countless hours learning machining and shop practices.

            <h2>What is my biggest opportunity for growth?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                The biggest struggle I've had to deal with in the last few years has been my mental health. The
                transition from high school to college proved very rough for me, with no help from the COVID-19
                pandemic. While depression and anxiety were issues I had faced in the past, the move to college brought
                me to the lowest points I had faced. I'm happy to say I've found new purpose in my life and am poised to
                again reach my goals. Though anxiety and depression will be something I will likely have to deal with my
                entire life, I am always learning new ways to keep my mental health in the best shape it can be.

            <h2>What are my short term goals?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                For the next few years, my goal is to graduate with an associate degree in computer science and take
                that degree to a four-year university to earn a bachelor's degree. I've made it a priority to find
                employment in a tech position to get more real-world experience and further my practical skills.

            <h2>What are my long term dreams?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                My dream is to work in the video game development industry. I love making games and want my skills to go
                towards giving people entertainment that leaves a lasting impression. As long as what I'm doing makes
                the world a net better place, I'll be happy!
